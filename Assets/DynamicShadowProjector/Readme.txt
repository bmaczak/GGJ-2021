Dynamic Shadow Projector version 1.1.8

This simple Unity asset provides a few components to render a shadow onto a render texture so that the render texture can be used with Blob Shadow Projector. Blob Shadow Projector is usually used for dropping a round blurry shadow which is not suitable for a skinned mesh object. This asset enables a projector to drop a dynamic shadow which is perfect for skinned mesh objects.

The usage is very simple. Add "Draw Target Object" component to a projector object, and fill up necessary fields.
